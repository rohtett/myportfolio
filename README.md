# My Portfolio
about my website
## User Experience
This is a website I created to showcase my skills with programming and my design ideas. It will mostly be used by individuals who have an interest in my work, as well as business owners or employers who may want to commission my work. 
### User Stories
- As the creator, I want people to be able to see my skill-set and experience what it is I can do with my programming knowledge. I want them to be able to learn about my design practices and see if it I can create something for the other users of the website.
- Business owners, or other individuals who would otherwise want want to commission a website, would want to see if the websites I create is something they want for their business (or personal use) and to see if any of the qualities they are looking for is reflected within it.
- As a potential employer, I would want to witness the design that the creator can produce, whether they are able to effectively manipulate all of the HTML and CCS features they have implemented. I may also want to test the limits of some of their functions such as responsiveness, and any bugs or faults in the code of functionality. 
- An interested individual (of the three above) would further like to contact the creator about comissioning work or offering employ.
