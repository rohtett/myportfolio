# My Portfolio
about my website
## User Experience
- Potential business owners who may wish to request a website to be made.
- Other potential individuals who may want to commission a website made by me.
- Potential employers who may wish to view my skillset as well as learn more about me. 
### User Stories
- As the creator, I want people to be able to see my skill-set and experience what it is I can do with my programming knowledge. I want them to be able to learn about my design practices and see if it I can create something for the other users of the website.
- Business owners, or other individuals who would otherwise want want to commission a website, would want to see if the websites I create is something they want for their business (or personal use) and to see if any of the qualities they are looking for is reflected within it.
- As a potential employer, I would want to witness the design that the creator can produce, whether they are able to effectively manipulate all of the HTML and CCS features they have implemented. I may also want to test the limits of some of their functions such as responsiveness, and any bugs or faults in the code of functionality. 
- An interested individual (of the three above) would further like to contact the creator about comissioning work or offering employ.
